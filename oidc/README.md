Extend your secure deployment by integrating **authentication and authorization** via **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**.

---

## üñº Architecture Overview

![Topology](media/topology.svg)

**Flow Summary:**
- Requests routed through **Traefik Ingress**
- Services protected with **Airlock Microgateway** in **sidecarless data plane mode**
- Observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail)
- Authentication via **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD)**

## üåê Access the Apps

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/` | Public |
| `/user` | User role required (group assigned to user account in Azure Entra ID tenant) |
| `/admin` | Admin role required (group assigned to user account in Azure Entra ID tenant) |

- Webserver Base URL: https://webserver-127-0-0-1.nip.io:8081/

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
* Install [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/).

> [!NOTE]
> This example is built for Rancher Desktop with containerd as container engine. Nevertheless, it should also work with any other Kubernetes distributions. Simply ensure the following:
> * Ensure the [Airlock Microgateway requirements](https://docs.airlock.com/microgateway/latest/#data/1660804711882.html) are met.
> * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is installed.
> * [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) is installed.
> * [kustomize](https://kustomize.io) >= 5.2.1 is installed.
> * An Ingress Controller (e.g. Traefik, Ingress Nginx, ...) is deployed.

## Airlock OIDC Microgateway prerequisites

This example is implemented on top of the base demo, [web protection](../web-protect). Please ensure you have it already set up correctly.

**If any of the prerequisites is missing, please install it according to the [web protection](../web-protect) example**

> * Microgateway with valid license and experimental Gateway API CRDs is deployed 
> * cert-manager is deployed
> * logging, monitoring and reporting stack is deployed

## üõ† Deployment Steps
> [!WARNING]
> Be aware that this is an example and some security settings are disabled to make this demo as simple as possible (e.g. authentication enforcement, restrictive deny rule configuration and other security settings).

## Deploy CA
```bash
kubectl kustomize --enable-helm manifests/ca | kubectl apply --server-side -f -
```

## Deploy Redis
```bash
kubectl kustomize --enable-helm manifests/redis-sessionstore | kubectl apply --server-side -f -
```

## Deploy Webserver
```bash
kubectl kustomize --enable-helm manifests | kubectl apply --server-side -f -
kubectl -n oidc rollout status deployment webserver
```

 > [!WARNING] 
 > If Airlock Microgateway was already deployed and you switched the Gateway API standard to *experimental* (which is required for this example), you may encounter an "error 500".
 > To resolve this:  
 > 1. Delete the Microgateway operator pods. They will restart automatically with the new *experimental* Gateway API CRDs.  
 > 2. Then, delete and reapply the `BackendTLSPolicy` manually.  
  
 ```bash
 kubectl delete pod -n airlock-microgateway-system $(kubectl get pods -n airlock-microgateway-system -o name | grep airlock-microgateway-operator-)
 
 kubectl delete -n oidc backendtlspolicies.gateway.networking.k8s.io webserver-tls && kubectl apply -f manifests/webserver-microgateway-config/backendtlspolicy.yaml
 ```


## Authentication with browser

|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /      | Unauthenticated access possible                                        |
| /admin | Authentication required                                                |
| /user  | Authentication required                                                |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- The limit of Groups in an OIDC token is limited to 200 by Microsoft.
- In larger organisations this limit can easiely be exceeded.
- To avoid running into issues due to this limit, an Entra ID administrator should assign the registered OIDC application only the relevant group memberships (recommended for larger enterprises)
